        **IMPORTANT: Configure in board.h the order of the channels and set their labels accordingly!**
        
        The ADC channel order goes from 0 to 15 (unless otherwise set in regular config), skipping the disabled channels.
        You must define the ADC channels in these lines:
              
            #define ADC_CH_1ST          ADC_CHANNEL_1             // First used channel:  CH1
            #define ADC_CH_2ND          ADC_CHANNEL_4             // Second used channel: CH4
            #define ADC_CH_3RD          ADC_CHANNEL_7             // Third used channel:  CH7
            #define ADC_CH_4TH          ADC_CHANNEL_9             // Fourth used channel: CH9
        
        Also, they must be adjusted depending on the signal connected to them:
      
            #define ADC_1st             VREF                     // First used channel measures VREF
            #define ADC_2nd             NTC                      // Second used channel measures NTC
            #define ADC_3rd             VIN                      // Third used channel measures VIN
            #define ADC_3rd             TIP                      // Fourth used channel measures TIP
                
        Set the number for active ADC channels:
              
            #define ADC_Num            4                         // Number of active channels
                  
        Except the tip ADC input, all the others can be enabled or disabled:
        
            #define USE_VREF
            #define USE_VIN
            #define USE_NTC
       
        Power limit will not be available if VIN is disabled.
        When disabling NTC, ambient temperature is internally set to 35ÂºC.
		
    * DMA settings
        Pheripheral to memory
        Mode: Circular
        Data width: Half word on both.           
		
    * NVIC Settings
        DMAx channel interrupt enabled.
        ADC and COMP*** interrupts disabled 


**DELAY TIMER**<br>

    * Base timer
        Internal clock
        Internal clock division: No division
        Auto-reload preload: Enable
        Master/Slave mode: Disable
        Trigger event selection: Reset
        Prescaler: Don't care, it's adjusted within the program. It asumes the timer runs at CPU speed
                    Some timers may take haf the clock speed, depending on the bus!
                    In that case use #define TIMER_HALFCLOCK in board.h!
                    Check the Clock config in CUBEMX!
        Period: Don't care, it's adjusted within the program
        NVIC settings: General enabled


**PWM**<br>

    * GPIO
        User label: PWM
        Mode: TIMxCHx(N) ("x" and "N" depends on the selected pin)
        
    * TIMER
        Select timer assigned to the pin
        Check Activated
        Select channel assigned to the pin
        Mode: PWM Generation. Select CHx(N), as assigned to PIN. Ensure to select "N" if the pin has it!
        Prescaler: Don't care, it's adjusted within the program. It asumes the timer runs at CPU speed.
                     Some timers may take haf the clock speed, depending on the bus!
                     In that case use #define PWM_TIMER_HALFCLOCK in board.h!
                     Check the Clock config in CUBEMX!
        Period: Don't care, it's adjusted within the program.
        Pulse: Don't care, it's adjusted within the program.
        NVIC settings: Depending on the timer type, enable TIMx "Capture compare" if available, else use "Global interrupt".
